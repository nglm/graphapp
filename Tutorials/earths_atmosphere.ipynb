    "**Defintion: Atmospheric circulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Atmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air and together with ocean circulation is the means by which thermal energy is redistributed on the surface of the Earth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth's weather is a consequence of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its illumination by the Sun\n",
    "- The laws of thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the atmospheric circulation can be viewed as a heat engine driven by the Sun's energy, and whose energy sink, ultimately, is the blackness of space. The work produced by that engine causes the motion of the masses of air and in that process, it redistributes the energy absorbed by the Earth's surface near the tropics to the latitudes nearer the poles, and thence to space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forces that cause atmospheric motion include (`[Pri_WP]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pressure gradient force, causing an acceleration forcing air from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure.\n",
    "- gravity, accelerating objects directly towards the center of the Earth. \n",
    "- viscous friction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they create the forces that accelerate our atmosphere \n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The large-scale structure of the Earth's atmospheric circulation remains fairly constant. \n",
    "- The smaller scale weather systems occur \"randomly\", and long-range weather predictions of those cannot be made beyond ten days in practice, or a month in theory (see Chaos theory and the Butterfly effect).\n",
    "- The large-scale atmospheric circulation \"cells\" shift polewards in warmer periods (for example, interglacials compared to glacials), but remain largely constant as they are, fundamentally, a property of the Earth's size, rotation rate, heating and atmospheric depth, all of which change little.

    "- Regional models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions.\n",

    "Parameterization in the context of numerical weather prediction is a method of replacing processes that are too small-scale or complex to be physically represented in the model by a simplified process. This can be contrasted with other processes—e.g., large-scale flow of the atmosphere—that are explicitly resolved within the models. Associated with these parameterizations are various parameters used in the simplified processes\n",

    "Weather and climate model gridboxes have sides of between 5 kilometres and 300 kilometres . A typical cumulus cloud has a scale of less than 1 kilometre, and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion. Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication."
